w5orasync
=========
With w5orasync, you can syncronize an external oracle table with
an W5Base dataobject. To do this, you have to create a table
in your oracle database witch is name like the dataobject (replace
the doublepoints with _ chars). In this table you have to add
alle fields, you want to be synced.
f.e.:
We have the dataobject base::user, and we need the fields 
userid,givenname, surname and email in the external oracle 
database.

You have to do the folloing steps:

1) Create your table like ...

      CREATE TABLE base__user (userid     number(20) NOT NULL,
                               surname    varchar2(80),
                               givenname  varchar2(80),
                               email      varchar2(80),
                               w5lastsync date);
   
   The field w5lastsync is needed, to handel deltas on the
   table correctly. 

2) Create a configfile (f.e. mycon.conf) , in witch the 
   account informations are stored:

      ORAUSER="w5in"
      ORAPASS="????????"
      ORACONNECT="dbi:Oracle:orapslam"

      W5BASEUSER="service/myservice"
      W5BASEPASS="?????????"
      W5BASEURL="https://darwin.telekom.de/darwin/auth"

   Don't forget to create a tnsnames.ora entry for the oracle
   database (in the example "orapslam") 


3) Ensure, that all needed perl modules are installed. These
   are Data::Dumper , W5Base::API , LWP::UserAgent , DBD::Oracle

4) Call the sync (f.e. via cron):

      w5orasync.pl -c mycon base::user
