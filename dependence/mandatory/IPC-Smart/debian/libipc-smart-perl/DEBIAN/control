Description: Shm interface to talk between parent and daughter processes
 IPC::Smart provides a very smart interface to shared memory, allowing
 data to be efficiently communicated between processes.  It is derived
 from the module IPC::ShareLite.
 .
 System must support SysV IPC (shared memory and semaphores) in order to
 use this module.
 .
 IPC::Smart provides an abstraction of the shared memory and
 semaphore facilities of SysV IPC, allowing the storage of arbitrarily
 large data; the module automatically acquires and removes shared memory
 segments as needed.  Storage and retrieval of data is atomic, and
 locking functions are provided for higher-level synchronization.
 .
 In many respects, this module is similar to IPC::Shareable.  However,
 IPC::Smart does not provide a tied interface, does not
 (automatically) allow the storage of variables, and is written in C
 for additional speed.
 .
 This description was automagically extracted from the module by dh-make-perl.
