Generell handling, debuging, configuring and using of the W5Server
==================================================================

The W5Server is essentialy needed to process all asyncron and atomic
operation. The communication from the apache spare process and the
W5ServerClient commandline tool will be done over TCP. 

Security
========
The W5Server can invoke potentially security relevant jobs/events. This
fact needs to protect the W5Server to get connections from other hosts
besides the needed. This can be done by using the configuration option
"W5ServerAllow".


Act as secondary W5Server (experimental)
========================================
If there are the config options ...

 W5PrimaryServerHost
 W5PrimaryServerPort

... are set, the W5Server will try to connect at startup to 
the master (primary) W5Server. This configuration can be needed to
scale the process capability to handle a huge count of events on
multiple logical servers.

sbin/W5Server       =  The W5Server program
